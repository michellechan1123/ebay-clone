# ebay Clone

## Getting Started

1. Download [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
    
   It is free for students.

2. Download an AMP package and setup the integration with PhpStorm
   
   [Instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/installing-an-amp-package.html#integrating-xampp)

3. Clone this project using `git clone`

4. In your AMP package, set the document root to the project directory

5. Run your AMP package

6. Go to the server address on your browser. Check the port setting in your AMP package.
   
   This loads `index.php`
   
   e.g. For MAMP, PHP is running on port 8888, so the address is http://localhost:8888
